## The world

I got bored at work and made a little simulation of little things staying alive. 
<br />

It started as a headless program that would output statistics about the world.

Anyway I then wanted to see how my little entities were actually interacting in this very simple world I built for them, 
so I made a swing-powered ui.

## How to use
I highly recommend you fork so you can modify the source code. However, I did a bunch of control options to the start menu in the ui:<br />

Here is how the map view looks:<br />
